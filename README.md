# AADC 2018 - LITdrive

This is the main folder for the ADTF plugin development and the running of ADTF projects and contains all the delivered sources.

## Additional libraries

The following additional libraries need to be installed on the car.

### ZeroMQ

ZeroMQ is a low-overhead, low-latency, high-speed IPC library, which is used for pumping sensor data to a message queue and receiving it with another program, e.g. Python.

    cd /opt
    sudo git clone https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git
    sudo chown -R aadc:aadc libzmq
    cd /opt/libzmq
    mkdir build; cd build
    cmake ..
    make
	
On Windows, do the following:

	cd C:\SDKs
	git clone https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git
	md build; cd build
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..
	cmake --build . --target INSTALL --config Release
	
### FFTW

FFTW is a library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, used on the microphone samples.

    cd /opt
	sudo wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.3.8.tar.gz -O /tmp/fftw.tar.gz
	sudo mkdir fftw
	sudo tar -xzf /tmp/fftw.tar.gz -C fftw
    sudo chown -R aadc:aadc fftw
    cd /opt/fftw/fftw-3.3.8
    mkdir build; cd build
    cmake ..
    make
	echo '/opt/fftw/fftw-3.3.8/build/' | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/fftw.conf	
	sudo ldconfig
	
On Windows, download the 64 bit binaries from [here](ftp://ftp.fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw-3.3.5-dll64.zip), extract the contents to `C:\SDK\fftw\fftw-3.3.5-dll64` and execute the following commands in a VS2015 Developer Console (to generate the `*.lib` files from the `*.dll` files):

	cd C:\SDK\fftw\fftw-3.3.5-dll64
	lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3f-3.def
	lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3-3.def
	lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3l-3.def

## Structure

### Folders

- `_build_user:` temporary folder which is generated by calling `build_user.sh` or `build_user_win.bat` and is used while building plugins
- `_build_base:` temporary folder which is generated by calling `build_base.sh` or `build_base_win.bat` and is used while building plugins
- `_build_demo:` temporary folder which is generated by calling `build_demo.sh` or `build_demo_win.bat` and is used while building plugins
- `_install:` temporary folder which is generated in build process and contains all the generated binaries
- `config:` Some demo ADTF configurations can be found here
- `configuration_files:` Here a lot of useful files located, e.g. calibration files for the camera, an example of a manueverlist and many more
- `doc:` Documentation folder
- `include:` Some general sources are located here which are used by all projects
- `src/aadcUser:` Here are some template plugins for the teams located. The teams are advised to include all their filters in this project.
- `src/aadcBase:` In the base folder are the ADTF base plugins contained which must be used by all teams. The final project running at the competition must contain these filters.
- `src/aadcDemo:` Here are a lot of demo filters  contained which can be used by the teams or can also be modified by the teams on their own.
