# AADC 2018 - LITdrive

This is the main folder for the ADTF plugin development and the running of ADTF projects and contains all the delivered sources.

## Additional libraries

The following additional libraries need to be installed on the car.

### ZeroMQ

ZeroMQ is a low-overhead, low-latency, high-speed IPC library, which is used for pumping sensor data to a message queue and receiving it with another program, e.g. Python.

    cd /opt
    sudo git clone https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git
    sudo chown -R aadc:aadc libzmq
    cd /opt/libzmq
    mkdir build; cd build
    cmake ..
    make
	
On Windows, do the following:

	cd C:\SDKs
	git clone https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git
	md build; cd build
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..
	cmake --build . --target INSTALL --config Release
	
### Tensorflow 1.8.0
Download archive from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CMnu1d_IwQAnup0BKL_es4i4T6XQRdqB), extract and copy to `/opt/tensorflow/1.8.0`

Pass information to ADTF:

    sudo touch /etc/ld.so.conf.d/tensorflow.conf
    sudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf.d/tensorflow.conf
    
Write `/opt/tensorflow/1.8.0/lib` inside the file, save and close

Reload the lookup table:
    
    sudo ldconfig
 

### Eigen 3.3.4
Download archive from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CMnu1d_IwQAnup0BKL_es4i4T6XQRdqB), extract and copy to `/opt/eigen/3.3.4`

### Protobuf 3.5.0
prepare environment

    sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool curl make g++ unzip
    
To get the source, download release for cpp v3.5 format .tar.gz or .zip packages in the release page:
       https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/latest

unzip, go to unzipped folder and execute:

    ./configure
    make
    make check
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig # refresh shared library cache.

### Nvidia driver 396.xx
    
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nvidia-396
    
restart machine and check with 

    nvidia-smi

## Structure

### Folders

- `_build_user:` temporary folder which is generated by calling `build_user.sh` or `build_user_win.bat` and is used while building plugins
- `_build_base:` temporary folder which is generated by calling `build_base.sh` or `build_base_win.bat` and is used while building plugins
- `_build_demo:` temporary folder which is generated by calling `build_demo.sh` or `build_demo_win.bat` and is used while building plugins
- `_install:` temporary folder which is generated in build process and contains all the generated binaries
- `config:` Some demo ADTF configurations can be found here
- `configuration_files:` Here a lot of useful files located, e.g. calibration files for the camera, an example of a manueverlist and many more
- `doc:` Documentation folder
- `include:` Some general sources are located here which are used by all projects
- `src/aadcUser:` Here are some template plugins for the teams located. The teams are advised to include all their filters in this project.
- `src/aadcBase:` In the base folder are the ADTF base plugins contained which must be used by all teams. The final project running at the competition must contain these filters.
- `src/aadcDemo:` Here are a lot of demo filters  contained which can be used by the teams or can also be modified by the teams on their own.
