This file opens the ourMap.jpg file, draws it accoring to the set scale within the python file, 
and lets you select points which it then saves in a csv.

How to:

1) open the terminal, and type: python prawPath.py
2) double click to set a point
3) once a second point is created, a line is drawn between them
4) draw all the points you want the car to drive, in the coresponding order
5) press 's' to save the points as csv named 'points.csv'
6) it also let's you save the figure as jpg ;)
