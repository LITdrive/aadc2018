###: ADTF Source Package:

Version:        1.1.1
Date:           2018.11.07
*	fixed "calibration file" property of Marker Detector in marker_detection subgraph in LiveVisualization project
*	removed obsolete TCP Streaming Sink for position output in UserConfiguration project
*	fixed problems in the jury application caused by loading maneuver files and some usability issues
*	enabled swift reuse of socket to jury application during competition in case the software on the car broke

Version:        1.1.0
Date:           2018.09.17
*   change BaslerCamera Property Naming unit for frame delay from [ms] to [micro s] to highlight that the frame delay is set in micro seconds
*   added microphone streaming source
*   added microphone visualization filter to visualize data from the microphone streaming source
*   reworked jury communication added jury communication streaming sink and source, adapted drivermodule - see SW description for more details
*   reimplemented jury procedure. Now there is a streaming sink to receive all the data from the Jury Application, an example Driver Module for showing how to process this data, and a streaming sink to sent data back to the Jury Application. See SW description for more details.
*   moved jury application to base project
*   extended jury application with some UI features
*   fixed bug with wrong image size in marker detector filter
*   fixed inconsistency for merge_left and merge_right in "aadc_jury.h"
*   Marker positioning filter now receives road sign map also over input pin and some algorithm improvements
*   Map Visualization now receives map over input pin 


###: changes:
Version:        1.0.2 
Date:           2018.06.29
*   fixed arduino logging
*   camera calibration: change type for number of frames to use for calibration from tInt8 to tUInt64 to prevent overflow errors, i.e. negative number of datasets to use
*   lane detection: adding functionality to show ROI, detection lines and min/maxLineWidth on output image
*   converter wheels: update property naming and fix missing direction assignment that backward speed is negative
*   wheel speed controller: update default values and property naming
*   object detection: using getNextSample instead of >> operator
*   fisheye undistortion: added opencv try...catch
*   cmake: moved ADTF_DIR and QT_DIR from scripts to AADCConfig.cmake
*   universal camera: modified default resolution
*   init tScanArray of tLaserScannerData with zeros
*   moved positioning into src/aadcBase and fixed cid naming
*   added new adtfproject config/UserConfiguration
*   extended build scripts for debug and release separately
*   default TCP Port for jury communication must not be 1000
*   fixed Bug in Map Visualization in reading xodr File


Version:        1.0.1
Date:           2018.06.08
*   cleared obsolete files
*   fixed some configuration issues
